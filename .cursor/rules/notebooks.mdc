# Notebooks Folder Usage

**The `notebooks/` folder is designated for temporary, experimental, and test scripts.**

## **What Goes in Notebooks Folder**

- **Temporary test scripts** for debugging and development
- **Experimental code** not ready for production
- **One-off analysis scripts** for data exploration
- **Development notebooks** (`.ipynb` files)
- **Quick prototypes** and proof-of-concept code
- **Testing utilities** like `test_detailed_scraping.py`

## **File Naming Conventions**

- Use descriptive names with clear purpose:
  ```
  test_detailed_scraping.py
  debug_pdf_processing.py
  experiment_new_chunking.py
  prototype_vector_search.ipynb
  analyze_scraping_results.py
  ```

## **Path References**

- **Scripts in notebooks must use proper path references:**
  ```python
  # ✅ DO: Correct path for notebooks folder
  sys.path.insert(0, str(Path(__file__).parent.parent / "src"))

  # ❌ DON'T: Wrong path that assumes root directory
  sys.path.insert(0, str(Path(__file__).parent / "src"))
  ```

## **Temporary Nature**

- **Files in notebooks/ are considered temporary**
- **Delete or archive** scripts when no longer needed
- **Don't commit large data files** or outputs to notebooks/
- **Document purpose** at top of each script

## **What Stays Out**

- **Production code** belongs in `src/`
- **Configuration files** belong in root
- **Documentation** belongs in root or docs/
- **Tests for CI/CD** belong in `tests/`

## **Examples**

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""
TEMPORARY: Test script for debugging detailed scraping.
Purpose: Verify improved delays reduce server errors.
Created: 2025-08-27
TODO: Delete after production validation
"""

import sys
from pathlib import Path

# Correct path reference from notebooks/
sys.path.insert(0, str(Path(__file__).parent.parent / "src"))
```

## **Cleanup Guidelines**

- **Review notebooks/ monthly** for unused files
- **Archive important experiments** to separate location
- **Document learnings** in main codebase before deletion
- **Keep notebooks/ lean** and focused on current work

*Keep the notebooks folder clean and purposeful. It's a workspace, not a permanent home.*
